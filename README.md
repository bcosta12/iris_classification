# iris_classification
"Imagine you are a botanist seeking an automated way to categorize each Iris flower you find. Machine learning provides many algorithms to statistically classify flowers. For instance, a sophisticated machine learning program could classify flowers based on photographs. Our ambitions are more modestâ€”we're going to classify Iris flowers based on the length and width measurements of their sepals and petals."
